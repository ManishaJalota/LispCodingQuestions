LispProject
This is a school project given to us on Lisp.I solved two questions based on lists in lisp
Difficulty level: Easy

Note: Lisp is a functional programming language. Lists are everything in lisp. Syntax is a bit difficult but once understood can be very helpful in artificial intelligence.
